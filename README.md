# Project Reflection

## Project Overview
In this project, I made a web app that works for both customers and admins. At the end, I added a way for the admin to log in safely. This README explains how the app works and what I learned while making it.

## How It Works
I used a few tools to build the front of the app. These tools include Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page app (SPA). Each one helps in a different way. Express HTML makes the structure of the web pages. JavaScript helps make the pages do things when you click or type. The SPA makes everything load faster without reloading the page.

The back of the app uses a NoSQL database called MongoDB. This kind of database is good because it can store lots of different kinds of data without needing to follow a strict set of rules.

## How It All Connects
JavaScript and JSON are a little different. JavaScript is a language that makes websites interactive. JSON is a way to organize and share data. It helps the front part of the app and the back part of the app talk to each other.

While building the app, I changed some of my code to make it better. This is called refactoring. I also reused some design parts, like buttons or forms, so I did not have to make them from scratch every time. This made the app easier to update and quicker to build.

## Testing the App
Testing helps make sure the app works correctly. I learned how to test API endpoints, which are like doors where the front and back parts of the app send and get data. When I added a login for the admin, it made testing harder because I needed to make sure the login was safe and worked well.

## What I Learned
This course helped me get closer to my career goals. I learned how to better make a web app, which will help me find a job. I got better at coding, working with databases, and keeping data safe. These skills will help me in the future when I want to work in tech.
